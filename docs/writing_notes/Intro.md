# Writing

Writing is an essential tool of persuasion, and it's one of the tools that we can use to influence others and transfer ideas. While we know writing from the start, there are a few techniques that we can learn to become a better writer. Being a better writer can help us in many fields, even if writing is not directly associated with that field or not.

We often assume that people who are smart are good writers, but that's not always true. Conversely, we hear it rare that people say he is a good writer but not that smart. So, one of the ways to appear effective and smart is to pick up the skills of good writing and the art of good persuasion. 

If we write good, we will be able to persuade people better, and communicate our ideas better. We will be able to direct people to what we want them to do. It's a good way to gaining influence.

It's a known fact that most people don't read articles online these days. So even more essential to write effectively, so that one can hold their attention. A big chunk of people get just bounced off when they arrive at the article, and a whole lot of them just leave even before arriving at the centre of the page. And a very minor portion of people read the whole article. 

Some even share the article and leave the page before they have read the article as whole. 

We should learn to write effectively and hold on to the reader's attention. And one of the ways to do that is to know our reader. Who they are, what they do, what their life is, and why are they reading what we write. Only when we understand our reader better, then we will be able to become an effective writer.
