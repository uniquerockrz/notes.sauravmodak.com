# Writing

Writing is an essential tool of persuasion, and it's one of the tools that we can use to influence others and transfer ideas. While we know writing from the start, there are a few techniques that we can learn to become a better writer. Being a better writer can help us in many fields, even if writing is not directly associated with that field or not.

We often assume that people who are smart are good writers, but that's not always true. Conversely, we hear it rare that people say he is a good writer but not that smart. So, one of the ways to appear effective and smart is to pick up the skills of good writing and the art of good persuasion. 

If we write good, we will be able to persuade people better, and communicate our ideas better. We will be able to direct people to what we want them to do. It's a good way to gaining influence. 

## People Don't Read Whole Articles Online These Days

It's a known fact that most people don't read articles online these days. So even more essential to write effectively, so that one can hold their attention. A big chunk of people get just bounced off when they arrive at the article, and a whole lot of them just leave even before arriving at the centre of the page. And a very minor portion of people read the whole article. 

Some even share the article and leave the page before they have read the article as whole. 

We should learn to write effectively and hold on to the reader's attention. And one of the ways to do that is to know our reader. Who they are, what they do, what their life is, and why are they reading what we write. Only when we understand our reader better, then we will be able to become an effective writer. 

## The Science Of Strong Business Writing

While writing may seem like an art, there is some solid science behind it. Researchers have shown that writing can trigger dopamine rush in the brain's pleasure centres and thus keep people hooked for more. 

There are 8 ways to keep a reader hooked to your writing. 

### Keeping It Simple

This means:

* Cutting down extra words that are not needed. 
* Use an active voice. 
* Keep what's important for the reader's end goal, and remove the tangential details. 

### Be Specific

People's brain associate the words with actual muscles in the body. If you say "Grab a knife", the readers regions associated with hands get fired. So the trick is to be more specific than before. Like if you say wipe instead of clean, it will be able to understand it better. 

* Be more vivid the the language. 
* Give a memorable shorthand, like "Tipping Point", "Blue Ocean Strategy" etc. 

### Surprise Readers

Our brains are made for making predictions and one of the ways to reward is to give it novelty. Some ways we can do it:

* Give some surprises in the text. 
* Have a good wordplay, e.g. "technological pinata".

### Emotional Writing

Our brain can process emotions faster than logic. So one of the ways to engage the reader is to use loaded language. Usage of idioms and metaphors are one of the ways that we can do it. 

It's better to understand the emotional context of the text we are writing and insert that in the text using language to create a more inspiring text. 

### Engage Curiosity

We are curious creatures and one of the ways we can build up us as a writer is to engage curiosity. One of the ways of doing that is to build up a mental image of what we are going to present to the reader before even presenting our solution, so that they can be hooked for more. 

### Make Readers Feel Smart

Readers want to be smart and experience the aha moment. Our writing should do that too. 

### Add A Social Connect

Humans are social animals and we feel more engaged if stuff we are reading has a social angle to it. 

* Add a human angle to any topic.
* Refer readers as "you".

### Storytelling

Engage people with a story. People love stories and want to be engaged in them. Make the story relatable with your readers.
