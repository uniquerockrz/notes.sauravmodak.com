# Atomic Habits

The author starts with his story of being injured in a baseball match while in high school. He then proceeds to narrates his story of how he improved his life from there on, finally being selected in the college team and being the best athlete in college. 

He says that it was possible because of series of small habits that he had built while he was in college. He makes this the foundation of the book and to change your life, series of small habits that create a big impact in the long term. 

He then narrates the story of British Cycling team that was in terrible shape, and how one of the coaches made it a force to be reckoned with in a few years. The coach had done a series of small changes to the athletes as well as their support system, that compounded over time and made a large impact in a few years. 

## 1 % Improvement Everyday

The author says that if one can make 1% improvement each they, in a year, one can become 37 times the person they had began with. Similarly, he narrates the destroying nature of bad habits, if one degrades by 1% everyday, they almost reduce to zero in a year. 

## Valley of Disappointment and Plateau of Latent Potential 

When we start a habit, we don't notice changes soon enough. So that's the reason that many people quit. The author says that the habits don't give immediate results, and there is a lag measure that happens when we monitor habits. However, the effort is not wasted, it is stored. Once we get past the valley of disappointment, we get to see amazing results, that often people perceive as overnight success. 

## Systems, not Goals

So how do we overcome this valley of disappointment? The author says that we should focus on the systems instead of the goals. He argues that even if we just focus on following the systems, instead of measuring the progress of the goals, we will be able to achieve the goals. Winners and Losers start with the same goal. Goals restrict your happiness as they usually take a long time to achieve. They are also in odds with the long term progress. 

## Change of Identity Vs Change of Outcomes & Processes

Many people when they change their habits, they tend to focus on the outcomes rather than the identity. An example can be, say someone wants to lose weight. They tend to focus on change of processes - e.g. not eating unhealthy foods, or doing exercise everyday. These are examples of focusing on the processes or the outcomes. 

This can stick for a while with some motivation, but doesn't work in the long term. Rather, to change habits for the long term, once should focus on changing the identity. 

Instead of planning to exercise everyday, one can say that I am the type of person who exercises everyday and eats healthy food. Instead of trying to quit smoking, one can say that I am a non smoker. 

So the question is, how does one change their identity? Well, it can be done by doing our habits repeatedly. 

The identity shapes our habits, and the vice versa is also true, the habits shape our identity. 

Each time we do an habit, it's a vote for that identity. Once the votes stack up enough, we become more confident, our belief changes, and that makes a change in our identity. 

This creates a loop, we do our habits because we want to become that person who does that habit, and we become that person who does that habit because we are that person who does that habit. 

So changing our habits and forming that identity is simple, we just need to repeat that habit repeatedly. We may miss a few times, but that's not important. What's important is that we do that habit majority of the time. 

## Why our brain builds habits?

Our brain is a complex organ whose one of the aim is to reduce cognitive load so that it can spare energy. The first time we encounter a problem, our brain works actively to solve that problem, and makes complex decisions. If we get a reward for solving that problem, the brain changes is chemistry so that the next time it gets the same problem, it can directly go to the solution instead of doing the same complex processing. So, if we encounter the same problem repeatedly, the the neural connections of our brain has already changed, and thus, instead of spending the same amount of time like the last time, it spends less time. Once we repeat the process enough, our brain has effectively learned this behaviour, and after enough repetitions, it can even perform this non consciously. 

This is how we learn to drive a car or ride a bike. And the same way, we learn to do habits. 

With repetition, our habits tend to take less effort and become more automatic. Simply saying, habits are mental shortcuts, some predefined scripts in our brain that our brain just subconsciously follows when it meets a predefined problem.

## How are habits are built?

The science says that a typical habit is composed of these 4 parts:

* The cue
* The craving
* The action
* The reward

The cue is something that triggers our brain. Say you come home from work and see the remote controller. The craving is something that tells our brain to do something, say you want to watch TV and get entertained. The effort or the action here is you switching on the TV. And finally, the reward, you get entertained. 

Over time, as the behaviour  becomes automatic, the steps get kinda merged. You come from work, you see the TV remove, you automatically start TV without thinking. You feel anxious, you start biting your nails. You feel overwhelmed at work, you start browsing social media. 

This is how we develop bad habits. 

The whole 4 steps above run in a feedback loop, with a reward in the end. Over time, your brain just associates the cue/trigger with the reward. This further enhances the habits and makes it a permanent footprint in your brain. 

We can further break down each habits in just two phases - the problem phase and the reward phase. 

The problem phase consists of the cue and the craving. The reward phase consists of the action and the reward. 

The author has broken down the method of habit building into 4 different laws:

* Make it obvious
* Make it attractive
* Make it easy
* Make it satisfying

Similarly, for bad habits, the laws can be

* Make it invisible
* Make it unattractive
* Make it difficult
* Make it unsatisfying

The ultimate aim of habits is to solve a problem with as less energy and effort as possible. 

## Make it Obvious

Our brain is very good at prediction, and one of the ways it does it is just recognise patterns and associate that with different things. This is the way doctors can recognise the disease just by seeing a patient, veteran army men can read radar by just seeing it and so on. The brain often interprets these pattern so fast, that we are unable to explain it, and thus call it intuition. 

One of the critical sep to change habits is to first recognise that they exists. We do most of the daily activities of the day without much mindfullness, in an automatic way. Similarly, our bad habits also get ingrained in our brain in this automatic patterns. 

### The Habits Scorecard

To build new habits, we have to get in hold of the current ones, and change them if necessary. The best way to do them is to make a list of current habits, and give them a score. See if they are useful for our long term goals, and are serving that purpose. 

Since our habits are so automatic, we will have to bring our conscious self and awareness when we do them to recognise them. We can do that by calling out loud. When we do an habit, we just need to say out loud of what we are doing, and then make a note of it. Over the day, we will have a list of habits that we do and can decide whether it's serving our purpose or not.

### Implementation Intentions

People tend to do habits when they have a clear idea and intention of doing it. So rather than people saying 'I will exercise for a healthier body' one can say 'I will exercise daily at 5pm in the local gym'. Our brain is good and interpreting different cues, and time and place often are the most powerful cues that are around. 

So, to create better habits, one should write something like this. 

I will do ~habit~ at ~time~ at ~place~.

This way, one will likely succeed. Often, what we lack for habit building is clarity, not the motivation.

### Habit Stacking

A good way to start new habits is to often stack them with existing ones. Say you do a particular morning routine everyday, if you would like to start exercising in the mornings, one of the good ways of doing it would be to add it to the morning routine itself. 

So, you can say something like this. 

After I had tea each morning, I will do 20 pushups. 

The habit stacking takes advantage of already existing momentum that you have built up, and you can continue doing same sets of habits one after the other. 

### Environment Cues

Our habits are not just associated with visual cues, but sometimes work because of the whole context associated with them. Say, if you start a reading habit in the couch, that will become the context of it, and whenever you are on the couch, your brain will trigger you to read. The same can have negative effects too, if you watch TV on the couch, your brain will trigger you to watch TV there.

One of the keys to a successful habits is to have unique environment contexts for each of them. If you want to start reading, have a special table and chair just for reading. If you want to start meditating, have a corner in the house just for that. 

If you have special environment context, you will have to spend less energy and will power to fight the environment.

### Self Control

We think one of the most important aspects of doing behaviour change is to have a good self control on oneself. However, self control is a overrated aspect and a short term one. The better way to change behaviour is to create a change in environment and make the bad habit much less accessible. 

Once the habit is ingrained in our brain, it is much hard to pull it out and change it. The better way to avoid doing the habit is to remove the cues and change the environment so as to not trigger the bad habit. 

These cover the first law of behaviour change - make it obvious. 

## Make It Attractive

This is the second law of behaviour change, and it is making the habits attractive. Our brain loves to do things that are more attractive to us, and the reason that it does it because it craves for things that we want. 

Why does the brain do so? The answer lies in dopamine. We used to say that dopamine is the chemical of pleasure, but it's actually a chemical of desire. The more dopamine releases because of thing, the more we would want something. It is also a chemical of novelty, the more new rewards that we get, the more dopamine is released. 

However, dopamine is not released only when getting the reward, but also when we are anticipating for a reward. If we know that because of an action, we are likely going to get a reward, the more dopamine we are going to get. This feedback loop can be used to build more habits and stick with them. 

The wanting or craving of something is more effective than just liking it. Our brain's wanting centres are much bigger than liking or pleasure centres. 

### Temptation Bundling

If there are some habits that we want to do, but have trouble doing it, it is better to bundle them with something that we like and crave. Examples can be, working out while watching TV, or meditating before reading a newspaper. These bundling of habits can also be used with habit stacks that we mentioned earlier, we can do one habit we need before one habit that we want. 

### Joining a Tribe

Humans are social beings and we tend to do things that make us belong to a tribe. The role of the culture we are in determines the behaviour that we have. So in order to build effective habits, it's better to be a part of a tribe that does the same kind of habits or where habit is the norm. 

We tend of imitate the behaviours of these three groups:

* the close: you are more likely to stay in shape or lose weight if people around you are slim.
* the many: humans tend to follow the norms and habits of the group at large
* the powerful: we want to follow the habits of people who are respected and the starts of our field.
