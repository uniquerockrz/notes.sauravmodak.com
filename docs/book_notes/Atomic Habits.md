# Atomic Habits

The author starts with his story of being injured in a baseball match while in high school. He then proceeds to narrates his story of how he improved his life from there on, finally being selected in the college team and being the best athlete in college. 

He says that it was possible because of series of small habits that he had built while he was in college. He makes this the foundation of the book and to change your life, series of small habits that create a big impact in the long term. 

He then narrates the story of British Cycling team that was in terrible shape, and how one of the coaches made it a force to be reckoned with in a few years. The coach had done a series of small changes to the athletes as well as their support system, that compounded over time and made a large impact in a few years. 

## 1 % Improvement Everyday

The author says that if one can make 1% improvement each they, in a year, one can become 37 times the person they had began with. Similarly, he narrates the destroying nature of bad habits, if one degrades by 1% everyday, they almost reduce to zero in a year. 

## Valley of Disappointment and Plateau of Latent Potential 

When we start a habit, we don't notice changes soon enough. So that's the reason that many people quit. The author says that the habits don't give immediate results, and there is a lag measure that happens when we monitor habits. However, the effort is not wasted, it is stored. Once we get past the valley of disappointment, we get to see amazing results, that often people perceive as overnight success. 

## Systems, not Goals

So how do we overcome this valley of disappointment? The author says that we should focus on the systems instead of the goals. He argues that even if we just focus on following the systems, instead of measuring the progress of the goals, we will be able to achieve the goals. Winners and Losers start with the same goal. Goals restrict your happiness as they usually take a long time to achieve. They are also in odds with the long term progress. 

## Change of Identity Vs Change of Outcomes & Processes

Many people when they change their habits, they tend to focus on the outcomes rather than the identity. An example can be, say someone wants to lose weight. They tend to focus on change of processes - e.g. not eating unhealthy foods, or doing exercise everyday. These are examples of focusing on the processes or the outcomes. 

This can stick for a while with some motivation, but doesn't work in the long term. Rather, to change habits for the long term, once should focus on changing the identity. 

Instead of planning to exercise everyday, one can say that I am the type of person who exercises everyday and eats healthy food. Instead of trying to quit smoking, one can say that I am a non smoker. 

So the question is, how does one change their identity? Well, it can be done by doing our habits repeatedly. 

The identity shapes our habits, and the vice versa is also true, the habits shape our identity. 

Each time we do an habit, it's a vote for that identity. Once the votes stack up enough, we become more confident, our belief changes, and that makes a change in our identity. 

This creates a loop, we do our habits because we want to become that person who does that habit, and we become that person who does that habit because we are that person who does that habit. 

So changing our habits and forming that identity is simple, we just need to repeat that habit repeatedly. We may miss a few times, but that's not important. What's important is that we do that habit majority of the time. 

## Why our brain builds habits?

Our brain is a complex organ whose one of the aim is to reduce cognitive load so that it can spare energy. The first time we encounter a problem, our brain works actively to solve that problem, and makes complex decisions. If we get a reward for solving that problem, the brain changes is chemistry so that the next time it gets the same problem, it can directly go to the solution instead of doing the same complex processing. So, if we encounter the same problem repeatedly, the the neural connections of our brain has already changed, and thus, instead of spending the same amount of time like the last time, it spends less time. Once we repeat the process enough, our brain has effectively learned this behaviour, and after enough repetitions, it can even perform this non consciously. 

This is how we learn to drive a car or ride a bike. And the same way, we learn to do habits.
