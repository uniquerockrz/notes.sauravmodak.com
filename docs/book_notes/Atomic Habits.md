# Atomic Habits

The author starts with his story of being injured in a baseball match while in high school. He then proceeds to narrates his story of how he improved his life from there on, finally being selected in the college team and being the best athlete in college. 

He says that it was possible because of series of small habits that he had built while he was in college. He makes this the foundation of the book and to change your life, series of small habits that create a big impact in the long term. 

He then narrates the story of British Cycling team that was in terrible shape, and how one of the coaches made it a force to be reckoned with in a few years. The coach had done a series of small changes to the athletes as well as their support system, that compounded over time and made a large impact in a few years. 

## 1 % Improvement Everyday

The author says that if one can make 1% improvement each they, in a year, one can become 37 times the person they had began with. Similarly, he narrates the destroying nature of bad habits, if one degrades by 1% everyday, they almost reduce to zero in a year. 

## Valley of Disappointment and Plateau of Latent Potential 

When we start a habit, we don't notice changes soon enough. So that's the reason that many people quit. The author says that the habits don't give immediate results, and there is a lag measure that happens when we monitor habits. However, the effort is not wasted, it is stored. Once we get past the valley of disappointment, we get to see amazing results, that often people perceive as overnight success. 

## Systems, not Goals

So how do we overcome this valley of disappointment? The author says that we should focus on the systems instead of the goals. He argues that even if we just focus on following the systems, instead of measuring the progress of the goals, we will be able to achieve the goals. Winners and Losers start with the same goal. Goals restrict your happiness as they usually take a long time to achieve. They are also in odds with the long term progress.
