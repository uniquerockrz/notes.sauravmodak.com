# Mindset

Let's say we are given a problem, that seems to be way beyond our capabilities. How would we react? The author narrates a similar story, where she brings in kids to study them, and gives them a set of mind puzzles to solve. 

Unlike us, she notices that the kids behave differently. When they face a problem that is quantifiably big for them, their attitude is to how to learn and solve it. 

Unlike us, who may think of us as lesser humans and give up. 

The centrepiece of this idea is that broadly people think in two ways. One is that their qualities, be it intelligence, emotion or other aspects of our personality, they are limited. So, we better put up our best show when we have a test in hand. 

The other idea is that all our qualities of personality, they can be grown and cultivated. They are not limited. 

This is not to say that every one can become greatest of all time. This is just that the pinnacle of our achievements are not known. So it need not be that the position we are currently in is the best that we can achieve. 

One great thing that I learnt was that the IQ test, it was not designed to measure one's intelligence, but to know which of the kids are not getting benefitted from the public school education. 

The people in these two categories also react to failure differently. One is aghast, lost and dejected. Other finds ways as to how to avoid the failures in the future. For one, it is the end of the world. For the other, it's another opportunity to improve.
