# Intro To Artificial Intelligence

All the things that a computer does is done via code written in programs. When we say of artificial intelligence, we may mean that the computer is able to write the code by itself and do the task. 

Some intelligence tasks involve doing mundane, formal or expert tasks. An AI should ideally also be able to pass the Turing Test. 

Some of the examples of such tasks are:

In the category above, AI till now have been able to master Expert and the Formal tasks. However, it's the Mundane tasks is where the AI is lacking even today. 

In AI we attempt to build intelligent entities. The breakdown of AI in computer science is given below.

There are a lot of things that come into AI, including Philosophy, Maths and Stats, Computer Science, Machine Learning, Biology and Linguistics, Psychology and finally Economics. 

## Knowledge And Rationality

There are a few things the computer cannot determine:

* Russell's Paradox: If we create a list of things, and then create another list which contains these lists, does this list contain itself?
* Halting Problem: Computer cannot know from a program when the program will halt, until the program is executed. 

When we have a set of facts, it is known as *data*. When we take the data, process it and get some output from it, we call it *information*. When we take that information and get some understanding from it we call it *knowledge*. Intelligence is needed for the knowledge. 

Rationality is when an entity acts the best possible way, with the data it has in hand. The ideal scenario will be for AI systems to act rationally. 

We design the AI entity something like shown here:

The AI agent interacts with an Environment via actions, and gets rewards. From the environment, it can also get the state of the environment to take actions. 

## Turing Test

This is how a Turing Test is performed. There is a Human Interrogator, which judges a task performed by another human and an AI system. If the Human interrogator cannot reliably distinguish between the Human and the AI system, we can say that the AI system has passed the Turing Test. 

## Types Of Learning

* Supervised: Right answers are provided, the system learns this and provides right answers from new input. 
* Unsupervised: Right answers are not provided, the system tries to make sense of data by itself. 
* Semi supervised: Right answers are provided for a few examples only. 
* Active: Computer can ask questions. 
* Lazy: Learner doesn't consolidate the findings.
* Reinforced: Hit and Trail method to reduce cost. 
* Transfer: Learning task B to do A.
* Deep: Using neural networks to do processing like the human brain.
