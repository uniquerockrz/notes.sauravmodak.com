# Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the simplest machine learning methods out there and it can be widely used for testing out a variety of data science problems. Machine learning however, consists of two variables:

* **response variable**: the variable we are trying to predict, usually represented as y
* **predictor variable**: the variable(s) on which we are trying to predict the response variable. 

This shows one of the examples of linear regression. We have the temperature of the day as the variable t, and the number of ice cream sold as n. We are trying to predict the number of ice cream sold based on the temperature. For this, we are using a linear regression model, which just draws a line through the points plotted on a graph.
